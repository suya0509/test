3. Mission Statement 
It is crucial for anyone experiencing stress to manage its mental triggers. Failing to do so 
could lead to loss of confidence, self-identity, and even stress-related health problems.  
So, the core goal of our project is to help users gain a deeper understanding of themselves 
and build a habit of regular journaling. Accordingly, our target audience consists of 
individuals seeking stress management, and our project aims to help them take control of 
their mental well-being by writing diaries with AI and releasing negative emotions through 
conversation. This process is designed to help people manage their stress and take control 
of their thoughts.
